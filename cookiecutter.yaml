  description: "Recent advances in neural rendering and embodied visual intelligence are reshaping AR/VR/XR systems, enabling immersive, interactive, and intelligent experiences across virtual and physical environments. This workshop invites original research contributions that span algorithms, systems, and architectures for neural rendering and AR/VR/XR computing." #\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:"
  topics:
    - "Neural rendering techniques, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), Gaussian Splatting, and learned scene representations."
    - "Systems and architectures for AR/VR/XR computing platforms."
    - "Low-latency, low-power pipelines for visual sensing, rendering, and display."
    - "Hardware acceleration for visual, perception-driven, and neural workloads."
    - "Sensor fusion and real-time 3D reconstruction from multimodal inputs."
    - "Distributed, edge, and edge–cloud systems for scalable visual processing."
    - "Simulation frameworks, benchmarks, and datasets for neural rendering and AR/VR/XR evaluation."
    - "Applications in robotics, telepresence, and embodied AI, including interactive and collaborative environments."
